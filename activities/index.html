          The Intelligent Motion Labratory (IML) is led by Professor Kris Hauser.  Starting in the Spring of 2017 and continuing through the Summer via a generous REU sponsorship, I've been working with Ph.D. student Fan Wang designing a robot attachment to robustly actuate switches, buttons, knobs, and other electronic input forms designed for human use.  The project is part of a larger one to create a nursing robot named TRINA.  Our project involves two primary components: (1) refining a standalone system which can consistently and autonomously actuate a wide variety of buttons, and (2) integrating the standalone system on the Baxter robot and coordinate motion planning to reach desired buttons with minimal manipulability at the end joint configuration.
          <!-- </a> --></p>
          <p> As of Fall 2017, we're taking a break from the project after having submitted a paper proposal to ICRA and I'm now working on a small project to create large quantities of realistic molds of corneas for the testing of an eye surgery robot being developed by Mark Draelos and Brenton Keller.

          The Duke Electric Vehicles club competes in the Shell Eco-marathon each year against around 160 teams from all over North and South America to create the most efficient car possible.  We have historically competed in the battery-electric prototype category in which the team has steadily improved over the years to finally win 1st place this past year.  This coming year, we are working on developing an entirely new hydrogen fuel cell car in addition to improving the battery-electric prototype car.  I am coleading the hydrogen effort with my good friend and colleague Shomik Verma under the supervision of club president Patrick Grady and faculty advisor Dr. Josiah Knight.  We all look forward to tackling the enormous challenges to come with the many ambitious goals involved with winning first place in two categories this year.

          In this project, I am leading a team of 5-10 fellow students to install solar powered phone chargers and night-time LED-lighting on Duke University's iconic blue-topped swinging benches.  The project was started in early 2016 under the <a href="http://dukesmarthome.com/">Duke University Smart Home</a> and I took leadership starting the summer of 2016.  As of Summer 2017, we have 2 completed installations on campus with plenty more to come in the Fall as well as plans to add live energy statistics available online, laptop chargers, and a host of other technologies to push the limits of small-scale solar powered systems.  Prototyping has been possible thanks to funding from the Duke Student Government, Duke's Engineering Student Government, Duke's Energy Initiative Fund, and the Duke Smart Home.  Duke's Housing, Dining, and Residential Life (HDRL) management has been and will be playing a major role in funding campus installations.
