          In this project, I am leading a team of 5-10 fellow students to install solar powered phone chargers and night-time LED-lighting on Duke University's iconic blue-topped swinging benches.  The project was started in early 2016 under the <a href="http://dukesmarthome.com/">Duke University Smart Home</a> and I took leadership starting the summer of 2016.  As of Summer 2017, we have 2 completed installations on campus with plenty more to come in the Fall as well as plans to add live energy statistics available online, laptop chargers, and a host of other technologies to push the limits of small-scale solar powered systems.  Prototyping has been possible thanks to funding from the Duke Student Government, Duke's Engineering Student Government, Duke's Energy Initiative Fund, and the Duke Smart Home.  Duke's Housing, Dining, and Residential Life (HDRL) management has been and will be playing a major role in funding campus installations.
