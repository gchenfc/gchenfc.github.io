  <h1>iPhone Charger Cable Repair</h1>

  <content>
    <h3>Intro</h3>
    	<p>
    	I noticed that I had at least 3 broken iPhone charger cables and figured it shouldn't be too hard to just cut them open and re-connect the broken wires to save myself a couple dollars on iphone chargers.  I told myself I would spend no longer than an hour playing around with it, because in the end I could just buy them fore ~$1.50 anyway so it wouldn't be worth the time to spend very long with it.  Mostly I wanted to see what was inside these cables in case I ever wanted to splice one into a different connector for some future electronics project.</p>

    <h4>Side Note</h4>
    	<p> I had cut a 30-pin iPhone cable apart maybe 4-5 years ago with the same intent to try to fix it and found it to be way too confusing and gave up.  Maybe now that I have more experience it will be easier!</p>
    <h3>Cable 1</h3>
    	<p> This first cable was the easiest.  I noticed that it had some green oxidation on the phone-side contacts and scraped it a bit with a utility knife.  Checking the continuity on a voltmeter I found that the connections to ground and VCC were indeed now working.  I cleaned it up a bit more and plugged it in for a test.  It worked!  Success!</p>

	<h3>Cable 2</h3>
		<a href="/blog/2017-9-16/wiresNoShrink.JPG"><img src="/blog/2017-9-16/wiresNoShrink.png" alt="wires no heat shrink" style="float:right" width=20%/></a>
		<p>This one was a bit harder.  Since the cable was very clearly frayed on the phone-side and all the contacts were crystal clear from oxidation, I knew it had to be some wiring issue.  I cut the cable completely close to the phone-side and started probing.</p>
		<p>
		I had a strong suspicion the metal shielding was grounded, but when I probed around, I couldn't find continuity between the shielding and the USB side ground so I thought maybe there was another break somewhere down the line.  I cut closer to the USB but after probing again more, I found out that there actually was continuity and I <a href="/blog/2017-9-16/wiresDone.JPG"><img src="/blog/2017-9-16/wiresDone.png" alt="wires with heat shrink" style="float:left" width=20%/></a>just didn't notice because I was using one alligator clip from the power supply instead of the multimeter by accident (oops!).  In any case, by this point I figured out that the only connection issue was for the ground wire between the phone port and where I cut.  I had to pry a bit further on the port to finally get to where I found continuity to the ground pin/contact.  I carefully soldered the ground and VCC pins to some standard 26ishAWG wire and heat shrank it.  I shorted the data cables since I wanted this only as a dedicated charger and didn't want to run another two wires.  <a href="/blog/2017-9-16/USBsideDone.JPG"><img src="/blog/2017-9-16/USBsideDone.png" alt="wires with heat shrink" style="float:right" width=20%/></a>As extra protection, I put a glob of epoxy around the solder joints between the small and large heat shrinks.
		</p>
		<p>
		I decided to just leave out the original white cable and use the black and red wires for the coolness factor.  I soldered the other (USB) side and heat shrank.  I intended to put a larger heat shrink around this side too, but I "forgot" to put on the heat shrink before soldering.  I actually just thought the phone-side connector was thin enough to slide the heat shrink over but I misjudged.  Instead I used electrical tape and that worked fine.
		</p>
	
	<h3>Cable 3</h3><a href="/blog/2017-9-16/fail.JPG"><img src="/blog/2017-9-16/fail.png" alt="failed wire" style="float:left" width=27%/></a>
		<p>This final cable was a failure.  I cut fairly close to the phone-side connector and couldn't get continuity in the red wire.  I peeled/cut more and still couldn't get continuity.  More and still nada.  Eventually, I cut apart the entire connector down to the "circit board" and there was still no continuity.  *sigh*  Well you win some and you lose some.  Still a cool experience to see the inside of this connector, and on the bright side I got a "USB breakout" wire out of it!</p>
	<h3>Reflection</h3>
		<p>I had a fun time ripping apart these cables and I was pretty satisfied to have resurrected 2 out of 3 of them!  I learned that I do indeed have the skills to disect USB cables and also learned that generally USB cables have 3 or 4 wires (white/green=data +/- and red/black=VCC/GND but sometimes black is omitted for cheap cables) tucked inside a shielding foil which is inside a mess of structural wire - all grounded.  I also learned the pinout of an iphone cable, which although not terribly useful, was still kind of neat to see that it's not super complicated.</p>
